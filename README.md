🛠️ Troubleshooting (Humanized!)
Q: My server won’t start!

Make sure MongoDB is running. Try mongod or brew services start mongodb-community (Mac). Still stuck? Check that your .env is correctly filled.

Q: CORS error?

Your backend should have this line:
app.use(cors({ origin: 'http://localhost:5173', credentials: true }));

Q: Database didn’t seed.

Did you run npm run seed inside bookit-backend? Make sure MongoDB is running first!

Q: Build won’t start?

Make sure you’re in the right folder (bookit-backend and bookit-frontend), ran npm install, and your .env files exist.

If all else fails, delete node_modules/, reinstall, restart the servers—usually fixes 99% of issues.
